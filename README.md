# Pokedex javaScript app

## Description

"Simple-js-app" is a small application with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that loads data from an external API and enables the viewing of data points in detail. 
The user is presented with a list of 150 pokemon names, and a modal with details can be viewed by the user by either clicking on one of the pokemon names, or by searching for a pokemon via the search bar (pressing the search button will also make the modal with the matching searched pokemon pop up).
The app was designed and developed by myself, as a project in the curriculum of the careerfoundry web development course, aided to learning javaScript and common libraries such as jQuery and Bootstrap.

## How to get the app running
Open the app link (the app is deployed on github pages) and browse through the pokemons. Access any pokemon details by clicking on any pokemon name in the list, or by searching for a pokemon (and clicking on the list item, or the search button). Press the "x" icon on the popup window to go back to the main list, or enter the "escape key from the keyboard. You can also move through pokemons by pressing the arrows at the bottom of the popup window (which will allow you to see the details of the previous and next pokemon), or by using the arrow keys in your keyboard.
